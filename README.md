# Project: Pigeon
The game to play if you don't like pigeons.


A game created by 5 first-year Creative Media and Game Technologies students of Hogeschool Rotterdam.

Bring order back to the world of pretty-much-domesticated-pigeons by pushing down the pigeon rebellion.

Fight your way through the pigeons to encounter the leaders of the uprising: Kanye Nest, The Godfeather and Stephen Squawking!
Defeat them to bring peace back to the skies above your car.
